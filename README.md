This is a demo of the [`{quadrangle}`](https://www.github.com/brianwdavis/quadrangle) package.

## Files:
See [`demo.R`](inst/demo.R) (at the console) and [`app.R`](inst/app.R) (Shiny).

## Notes:
This is an R package. If you wanted, you could install it using `dev_tools::install_github`.
If you (i.e. future me) need to deploy it from scratch, there is a missing file
from this repository, **`secret.txt`**, which contains the ID (as a bare string) 
of a Google Drive folder  that contains some images for the `demo.R` script.
